# Magical Beasts Manager

Take care of magical beasts from the Harry Potter world!

This is my first object-oriented(OOP) application using JavaScript.
At the time I was playing Hogwarts Legacy, I really like the frenchise so I decided to make this app related to it :D.

## Features

- **Stat Management**: Track hunger, mood, and energy (0-20 scale).
- **Caps min and max of status**: 'statCap' keeps the stats within their limits.
- **Interactive Actions**:
- 'feed()'
- 'snack()'
- 'play()'
- 'nap()'
- Note: The values that are added and retracted through actions may not be balanced.
